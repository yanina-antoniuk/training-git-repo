I've walked the distance, I paid my dues and tried to have a go at what I thought I knew was real, held
No appeal
I've been to places, I've seen the tidings,
I bought a book of rules for every coin that I could steal
And so I came to gaze upon the stars, when they were yet unborn
And consequently, tear at my old scars, and the mask I had outworn
So when I'm crying alone
Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone
